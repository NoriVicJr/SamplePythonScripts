SamplePythonScripts
===================

A collection of general purpose python scripts, created when I was working on my research project.
List:
1. createfile.py : When you have to create an awfully large amount of files inside a folder, it is not possible to create it by hand, use this utlity to specify the folder, the path, and the names to be given the files that'll be created
2. networking.py  : some simple scripts to do some amazing stuff over the network, for eg finding MAC address of a client in the network without having physical access to the machine
