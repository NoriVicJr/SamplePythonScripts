SamplePythonScripts
===================

A collection of small snippets in python for doing general purpose activities that we need to do over our machines. python is a very powerful tool for programming in general, you can easily replace shell scripting by scripting in python, and it is platform independant

List:

1. createfile.py : When you have to create an awfully large amount of files inside a folder, it is not possible to create it by hand, use this utlity to specify the folder, the path, and the names to be given the files that'll be created
2. networking.py  : some simple scripts to do some amazing stuff over the network, for eg finding MAC address of a client in the network without having physical access to the machine
