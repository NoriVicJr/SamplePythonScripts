SamplePythonScripts
===================

A collection of small snippets in python for doing general purpose activities that we need to do over our machines. python is a very powerful tool for programming in general, you can easily replace shell scripting by scripting in python, and it is platform independant.

These are snippets from my graduation research project, since I can not publish my project, I am publishing small portions of the project to give back to the community. And if you want me to write snippets for the problem you are facing then email me, I will publish them as soon as possible.  Enjoy.

List:

1. createfile.py : When you have to create an awfully large amount of files inside a folder, it is not possible to create it by hand, use this utlity to specify the folder, the path, and the names to be given the files that'll be created
2. networking.py  : some simple scripts to do some amazing stuff over the network, for eg finding MAC address of a client in the network without having physical access to the machine
3. bulkRename.py: rename multiple files programmatically
4. hex2int.py: we have a file EtherType, and we convert it to EtherType2, link for image: https://qph.is.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-cd53d1dd106f20dd19cff0197fb2ac05?convert_to_webp=true
5. list.py: we can list files in python
